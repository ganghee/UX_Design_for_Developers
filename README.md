## üåº Glossary

- **A/B Testing**: A/B testing can be used to compare the performance of a webpage, app, email, or advert by pitting a control, ‚ÄòA‚Äô, against a test variant, ‚ÄòB‚Äô.

[]()
- **Affordance**: Affordance is a property or feature of an object which presents a prompt on what can be done with this object. In short, affordances are cues which give a hint how users may interact with something, no matter physical or digital.

- **Agile UX**: Agile UX stands for collaboration-centered practice between designers and developers while they work on the product. This approach brings all the best from Agile development to UX design processes.

[]()
- **Backlog**: A backlog is a list of tasks required to support a larger strategic plan. In a product development context, it contains a prioritized list of items that the team has agreed to work on next. Typical items on a product backlog include user stories, changes to existing functionality, and bug fixes.

[]()
- **Card Sorting**: Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups. To conduct a card sort, you can use actual cards, pieces of paper, or one of several online card-sorting software tools.

[]()
- **Ethnography**: Ethnography is a study through direct observation of users in their natural environment rather than in a lab. The objective of this type of research is to gain insights into how users interact with things in their natural environment.

[]()
- **GUI**: A graphical user interface (GUI) is an interface through which a user interacts with electronic devices such as computers, hand-held devices and other appliances. This interface uses icons, menus and other visual indicator (graphics) representations to display information and related user controls, unlike text-based interfaces, where data and commands are in text.

[]()
- **Guide Tour**: Allow users to learn at their own pace using tooltips, overlays, models, and alerts hinting optimal use of an interface within the context of everyday use. Connect hints with clear completion states.

[]()
- **IA**: Information architecture is the half-art-half-science process of deciding how the content of a digital project will be organized and labeled. Great IA comes from having a profound understanding of the project itself and its intended audience. It‚Äôs an IA designer‚Äôs job to make sure the entire team understands the blueprint.

- **Interaction Design**: Interaction design can be understood in simple (but not simplified) terms: it is the design of the interaction between users and products. Most often when people talk about interaction design, the products tend to be software products like apps or websites. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible.

[]()
- **Mental Model**: Mental model is what the user believes about how a user experience works. Mental models are built in a user‚Äôs brain and are based on what they know from past interactions with websites, mobile phones, and other interactive products.

[]()
- **Lean UX**: Lean UX is focused on the experience under design and is less focused on deliverables than traditional UX. It requires a greater level of collaboration with the entire team. The core objective is to focus on obtaining feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. The nature of Agile development is to work in rapid, iterative cycles and Lean UX mimics these cycles to ensure that data generated can be used in each iteration.

[]()
- **Metaphor**: Metaphor is a set of user interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that users already have of other domains. The purpose of the interface metaphor is to give the user instantaneous knowledge about how to interact with the user interface.

[]()
- **MVP**: Minimum viable product (MVP) is a process for creating a production-ready product based on collaboration with users that undergoes continuous iterations and improvements until a ‚Äúfinal‚Äù product is created. MVP design iterations are based on quantitative data and qualitative customer feedback.

[]()
- **Object-Oriented UX**: The philosophy of OOUX is to encourage us as UX Designers to think about our core content as objects, and to think about this before considering any procedural actions. So before we dive straight into technical workflows and think about how the interface will function or appear, we can consider how our users will think about data as objects and align the product with a user‚Äôs mental model.

[]()
- **Onboarding**: An onboarding experience is a way to introduce users to a new product, app, or feature. Onboarding UX is the design of a flow or series of flows that give the user a guided introduction to the product, set up some initial preferences, or point out critical UI elements in an interface.

[]()
- **Paper Prototypes**: Paper prototypes are a way to test your design concepts without mocking up the interface digitally. You sketch how you imagine the screens in an interface to look, then you can move the screens around depending on ‚Äòuser input‚Äô.

[]()
- **Persona**: Personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Persona representations include behavioral patterns, goals, motivations, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which a persona operates.

[]()
- **Prototype**: A prototype is a primitive representation or version of a product that a design team or front-end-development team typically creates during the design process. The goal of a prototype is to test the flow of a design solution and gather feedback on it from both internal and external parties before constructing the final product. The state of a prototype is fluid as the team revises the design iteratively based on user feedback.

[]()
- **Scenario**: User scenarios are stories which designers create to show how users might act to achieve a goal in a system or environment. Designers make scenarios to understand users‚Äô motivations, needs, barriers and more in the context of how they would use a design, and to help ideate, iterate and usability-test optimal solutions.

[]()
- **Scrum**: Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

[]()
- **Sprint**: The design sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, rapid design prototyping, and testing ideas.

[]()
- **Task Analysis**: Task analysis is a process that helps UX designers learn how users actually go about completing tasks with a product.

[]()
- **UI**: User interface(UI) is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with.

[]()
- **UX**: User experience(UX) design is the process design teams to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.

[]()
- **Walkthrough**: A product walkthrough appears when you use a product for the first time. It‚Äôs like someone taking your hand and guiding you through how a product works so that you don‚Äôt get confused.

[]()
- **Wireframing**: Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
